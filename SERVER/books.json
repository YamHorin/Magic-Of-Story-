She thought she was the queen of the house! But one day, a wiggly-tailed puppy arrived. He was a golden retriever named Gus, and he was full of bouncy energy! Gus loved to lick faces, chew on toys, and bark at… well, pretty much everything! Snowball wasn't sure what to think of this new, loud creature. He seemed to think playing was way more important than napping. Could a cat and a dog ever be friends?",

Mrs. Gable, their owner, would gently say, \"Give her time, Gus. Cats and dogs sometimes need time to understand each other.\" So Gus tried to be patient, watching Snowball from a distance, wondering what it would take to be friends.",

Gus licked Snowball's ear gently. They stayed there, close together, listening to the storm rumble outside. The next morning, Snowball was even seen letting Gus lick her nose! Maybe, just maybe, these two were finally starting to understand each other.",

      "text_page": "Once upon a time, in a cozy little town nestled between rolling green hills, lived a fluffy white cat named Snowball. Snowball loved napping in sunbeams, batting at dust bunnies, and generally being a very important cat. He ruled his house with a gentle paw. Across the street, lived a bouncy, brown dog named Rusty. Rusty loved chasing squirrels, barking at mail trucks (who were clearly up to no good!), and wagging his tail with enough enthusiasm to knock over small children (accidentally, of course!). Snowball and Rusty were, well, not friends. They were, in fact, the opposite.",

Rusty didn't understand Snowball's love for peace and quiet. They seemed destined to be rivals forever, separated by a fence and a whole lot of misunderstanding.",

He rubbed against Rusty's leg, a soft purr rumbling in his chest. Rusty wagged his tail, a happy grin on his face. Maybe, just maybe, being friends wasn't so bad after all. From that day on, Snowball and Rusty learned that even the biggest differences can be overcome with a little kindness and a whole lot of understanding.",

And surprisingly, she smiled. \"We're moving to China, Leo. Your father got a new job in Beijing!\" Leo's eyes widened. This wasn't just a dream anymore. It was happening!",
